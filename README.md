# Smart-ISS-Visibility-Predictor
Most ISS trackers tell you WHEN it passes overhead, but ours uses AI to predict if you'll ACTUALLY see it. Our machine learning model analyzes weather patterns, cloud cover, and atmospheric conditions to give you a visibility probability. Watch - it's currently 73% likely you'll see the ISS in tonight's pass!
